- the second technique for reducing the number of places where exceptions must be handled is [[exception masking]] with this approach an exceptional condition is detected and handled at a low level in the system so that higher levels of software need not be aware of the condition. Exception masking is particularly common in [[distributed system]].  for instance in a network transport protocol such as [[TCP]] packets can be dropped for various reasons such as corruption and congestion. [[TCP]] makes packet loss by resending lost packet with its implementation, so all data eventually gets through and clients are unaware of the dropped packets.
- Exception masking doesn't work in all situations but it is a powerful tool in the situations where it works. it results in deeper classes since it reduces the class's interface and adds functionality in form of code that masks the exception.
- also exception masking is an example of [[pull complexity downwards]]
