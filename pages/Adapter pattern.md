	 - The **adapter pattern** allows classes that have different interfaces (properties/methods of an object) to work together. It translates the interface for a class to make it compatible with another class.

	 - This pattern is useful if an API is modified or new implementations are added to it. In this case, if the other parts of a system are still using the old API, the adapter pattern will translate the interface so that the two can work together.

		 - In software engineering, the adapter pattern is a software design pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.
