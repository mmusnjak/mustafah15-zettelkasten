- in-code documentation plays a crucial role in software design. Comments are essential to help developers understand a system and work efficiently, but the role of comments goes beyond this. Documentation also plays an important role in abstraction without comments you can't hide complexity. Finally, the process of writing comments, if done correctly will actually improve a system's design Conversely, a good software design loses much of it's value if it is poorly documented.
- Many developers think that comments are a waste of time others see the value in comments but somehow never get around to writing them, However even in teams that encourage documentation, comments are often viewed as drudge work and many developers don't understand how to write them, so the resulting documentation is often mediocre.
- Inadequate documentation creates a huge and unnecessary drag on software development.
- There are three things that you should be convinced with about comments
	- good comments can make a big difference in the over all quality of software
	- it's not hard to write good comments
	- writing comments can be actually fun
- there are three justifications that developers usually use why they don't write comments
	- [[philosophy of software design/why write comments/ the myth of good code is self-documenting]]
	- [[philosophy of software design/why write comments/i don't have time to write comments]]
	- [[philosophy of software design/why write comments/comments get out of date]]
	- [[philosophy of software design/why write comments/comments might be worthless]]
- [[philosophy of software design/why write comments/benefits of well written comments]]
