title: Dependency Inversion Principle
---

- __ High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. __
	 - __High-level modules __in DIP are modules that appear on the higher part of the UML diagram and depend on the abstraction layer. __Abstractions__  can be an interface or an abstract class. __Low-level modules__ are the ones in the lower level of the diagram and are the actual implementations of the abstraction layer.
