	 - The facade pattern allows you to hide all the messy logic from the client and only display the clear and easy-to-use interface to them. This allows them to interact with an API easily in a less error-prone way and without accessing the inner workings directly.

	 - A simple example of the facade pattern is placing an order at a restaurant. Imagine yourself as a customer who wants to eat at a restaurant. You are the client in this scenario. Depending on the place you go to eat, it’s either the waiter will take your order, or you’ll place it at the counter. Then, you’ll wait for a few minutes and the next thing you know, your food will be served.

	 - How was your food made? Which chef was assigned the task to make your food? What ingredients were used? How much stock was used or left afterwards? Who cleaned the kitchen after your food had been prepared? All of these complexities are hidden from you. These are the unnecessary details that you as a customer, don’t need to know.
